# foreign-object-segmentation

This project performs **detection and segmentation of foreign objects in X-ray images**.  
COCO-formatted labeled data has been used, and models are trained using the **Detectron2 framework**.

## Files

- **foreign_object_segmentation-full.ipynb**  
  The **full notebook** with all cell outputs. Contains training results, graphs, and all outputs.  


- **foreign_object_segmentation.ipynb**  
  Partially cleared outputs, **light version notebook**. Can be directly viewed on GitHub.  


- **foreign_object_segmentation.py**  
  Python script version of the notebook. Contains **all project code** and can be run as a `.py` file.  


## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in COCO format.  
2. Open the notebooks in Colab or run the `.py` script.  
3. Train and test segmentation models using Detectron2.
